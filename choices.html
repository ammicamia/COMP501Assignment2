            <p>The Freedom House Index (2019) investigation revealed that 40 out of 65 countries had government-run social media surveillance programs. Additionally, 89% of internet users were being monitored. Internet surveillance is an ever-evolving subject, and it's difficult to set out rules and guidelines without them becoming redundant in a short time. However, the choices we make about the future of internet surveillance have far-reaching ethical implications and must be handled with the utmost care. As our lives and society revolve more and more around the internet, our choices must be cognizant of possible future consequences.</p>
            <p>Below is a list of possible pathways we have outlined. By no means are any of these guaranteed to represent the future of internet surveillance, but rather a list of possibilities and ideas that could change how we view and interact with the internet.</p>
            <p>Choice 1: Extensive Surveillance for Security</p>
            <p>One common choice is to embrace extensive surveillance for enhanced security. Supporters argue that surveillance can detect and prevent cybercrimes, terrorism, and malicious activities. However, this approach raises ethical concerns about privacy invasion and the potential for abuse of power. Striking a balance between security and privacy is crucial, but it may be difficult.</p>
            <p>Choice 2: Stricter Privacy Protections</p>
            <p>Prioritizing stronger privacy measures is an additional option. Supporters of this strategy are adamant about defending people's rights and freedoms. Although it addresses ethical issues, it may also result in national security weaknesses and make it more difficult to look into and stop illegal activity. Developing efficient surveillance procedures that uphold individuals' right to privacy while ensuring public safety is a difficult task.</p>
            <p>Choice 3: Accountability and Transparency</p>
            <p>Emphasizing accountability and transparency in surveillance procedures is a third option. By ensuring that surveillance is conducted within a legal framework and is overseen, this strategy hopes to increase public trust. Even if this decision encourages moral governance, there may be drawbacks in a quickly changing digital environment where laws are frequently outpaced by technology.</p>
            <p>Choice 4: The Infinite Panopticon</p>
            <p>Imagine a world of digitalization wherein all online activities form an "Infinite Panopticon," thereby rendering privacy essentially obsolete. An internet where online interactions will be continuously monitored and fully transparent, able to be seen by anyone. An online world without secrets provides drastically increased accountability, less malicious activity, and streamlined investigations. The Infinite Panopticon questions established privacy standards and emphasizes the necessity of strong protections to strike a balance between openness and individual liberties.</p>
