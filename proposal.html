		<td><em>The panopticon is a theory that describes the concept of individuals being observed without knowing when they are being watched. It describes a basic design of a watchtower surrounded by cells where the watchman can see inside every cell, however the people cannot see the watchman and assume they are under constant surveillance. This leads to the assumption that since they never know when they are being watched, they are more likely to monitor their behavior.</em>
		<em>In this era, the panopticon theory can also be applied to various forms of online surveillance, such as data collection, online tracking, and government surveillance. With the recent developments and breakthroughs in technology, these forms of surveillances are improving at a rapid speed. This raises the concerns of 1) psychological effects on people such as paranoia as they have no knowledge of when and where they are being watched, and 2) invasion of privacy and misuse of their own personal data online. As internet users, we decided to research this topic because we are also at risk to falling victim to these concerns.</em></td>
