            <p>Through internet surveillance, we gain the ability to track the movements of potential suspects, including their activity on social media platforms and chat history. This proactive monitoring can be a powerful tool for crime prevention and intervention.</p>
            <p>By detecting concerning online behaviors, we can identify early warning signs and intervene before a situation escalates. When used responsibly and within the bounds of the law, internet surveillance can be a valuable tool for preventing and addressing crimes in real life and safeguarding the well-being of society.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, Internet Surveillance System has also been implemented in many IoT services such as shared bikes, shared motor vehicles, shared power banks, etc. While enjoying the convenience from easy-accessible IoT Services, users are required to provide their information to the system, which will be linked and analyzed through the bit data database. This has decreased property damaging and lost rate, as people know that they will have to take consequences. This measure has not only urge user to behave well on the shared properties, but also encouraged shared property business owners to increase their investments to the market, and as a result of this virtuous cycle, entrepreneurs are more likely to invest in upscale shared facilities that are typically less accessible but have the potential to enhance people's quality of life, such as shared digital devices, premium shared motor vehicles and other potential similar services.</p>
            <p>As Internet Surveillance Systems are developed and implemented, people can experience a significant increase of social security and decrease of crime rate. In Mainland China, a merged Internet and Physical Surveillance System, as known as Tianyan System, has brought the public's attention from preventing and intervening crimes.  All big data collected from various Internet Surveillance Systems, either from a government authority, or private businesses who are willing to share, are being processed in the central pool of the Tianyan System. With surveillance cameras and all Internet Surveillance information supplied, law enforcement authorities such as the police department can easily track a suspect’s location, his social media account, his payment habits, lifestyle habits and so on.</p>
            <p>These are not only used to stop crimes, it helps families and the public to find missing children, women, seniors, and to stop mental health crises as well. Specifically in Mainland China where is a good example of Internet Surveillance merged with big data and IoT services, a number of people are reported missing, or attempting suicide.</p>
            <p>Social Service agencies gain the opportunity to work along with Law enforcement agencies and access their Internet Surveillance systems, getting to know what has been going on in the subject’s life that has caused them to be missing, or seeking self-harm. This enables responders to swiftly assess whether it is a criminal abduction case involving third-party intervention or an accidental occurrence or is it something else. Moreover, in the context of individuals experiencing mental health crises, responders can evaluate recent significant life changes in their lives through information collected by the Internet Surveillance System from social media, lifestyle changes etc., enhancing their understanding of the subject and enabling them to provide targeted emergency intervention assistance.</p>
