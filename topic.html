            <p>Internet surveillance, or online surveillance refers to the monitoring, tracking, and possible collection of activities on the internet, communication between individuals/organizations and their data. It is at its core, the collection and analysis of information relating to online behavior. However, it has many different methods for different purposes both legitimate and questionable. It is often done without the consent or knowledge of the target. Some examples include government surveillance, corporate, data collection, encryption and security, censorship/content control, and surveillance for malicious purposes. (Gilman, 2018)</p>
            <p>Internet surveillance is very important and has proven to be beneficial in ways such as national security, which is essential when identifying and preventing possible threats such as espionage, cyberattacks, or terrorism. It allows the government to be one step ahead to respond and ensure the safety of its citizens. (Wright, 2013) Another example of its importance is seen during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Internet surveillance allowed health systems to track and assist in disaster management. This kind of emergency response and announcement are crucial to minimizing the amount of negative impact when the virus is spreading every minute.</p>
            <p>Internet surveillance is important for various purposes, but striking a balance with individual privacy is crucial. Legal frameworks and oversight mechanisms should be well established to ensure responsible surveillance.</p>
            <p>Proposed by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the late 18th century, the prison design of the Panopticon is characterized as that of a circular structure with a watchtower in its center. (Ethics Centre, 2021) From the watchtower, the observer is able to see into every individual room surrounding the tower. Yet, the room occupants are unable to discern whether or not the single observer is indeed watching them, or even present. The idea claims that this should lead the room occupants to be self-disciplined and comply with rules and norms. This is very similar to internet surveillance as we usually make sure not to share sensitive information, or stray from the norm online, in case someone is indeed monitoring our every move online.</p>
            <p>In today's technology-driven world, we've created a modern Panopticon much like Bentham's vision. Online surveillance is rampant and not always visible, while we users accept it for its benefits, the constant surveillance can raise the question of whether or not it genuinely is only for our good, or a mere psychological power over the masses. (Ellard, 2012)</p>
