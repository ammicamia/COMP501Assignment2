            <p>The internet, a primary means of connecting with others, has become a breeding ground for data collection and activity tracking, often under the guise of providing a more personalised online experience. Much like the panopticon, internet surveillance poses many risks to users everywhere. The uncertainty of whether individuals are being monitored can have a significant impact on their mental well-being. A study by Marder et al. (2016) found that the expectation of being monitored by an online audience made people self-conscious of their online activities. This self-awareness led to social anxiety and a constant need to watch their digital footprint, commonly known as “self-censoring” (Marder et al., 2016) where users restrain or filter their opinions, thoughts, or expressions before posting on online sites. These factors can potentially manifest into heavier psychological effects such as paranoia, as individuals are fearful of expressing their true self, even in private discussions, knowing that their words and actions could be recorded and used against them.</p>
            <p>Another risk associated with mental well-being is desensitisation, leading to normalisation of online surveillance and lost sense of privacy. Research conducted by a Finnish research group revealed that, with the exception of one participant, the surveillance evoked feelings of “annoyance, concern, anxiety, and even anger.” (Aalto University, 2012). However, these privacy concerns reached a plateau around three months, with the participants getting used to the constant presence of surveillance (Aalto University, 2012). As certain internet surveillance practices become more common, such as targeted advertising or pop-ups about accepting cookies, this can lead to individuals viewing them as a regular aspect of using online services. And with repetitive exposure, individuals may become accustomed to being monitored regularly.</p>
            <p>Convenience is often associated with positive experiences, which is another factor that is contributing to the normalisation of internet surveillance. Data collection is widely useful for improving real-time responses, access, and control over various devices. Weinberg et al. (2015) states that the Internet can benefit organisations in many ways; real-time decision making can be improved with immediate data collection and users can have the ability to access and control devices connected to the Internet even when away from home. With the internet, users are often offered this convenience with a single touch, from information to seamless transactions or personalised recommendations. This convenience can cause users to be more likely to accept some level of privacy invasion for the price of that convenience and over time, they may become accustomed to this trade-off, viewing it as an acceptable compromise. Through data collection and personalization, users may value this convenience over privacy concerns and thus also become desensitised.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, concerns also surround the invasion and use of a user’s privacy. Research by PCloud has shown that Instagram is one of the top apps that collect the most personal data, at 86%, with 79% being shared with third-party apps (Dimitrov, 2021) (see <b>Picture 1</b>). A user decided to download the data that Amazon has on them and is sent audio files of the times the user spoke with Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant technology (see <b>Picture 2</b>). This shows that even the miniscule things, such as the daily conversations people are not normally concerned about, are still being used against and for them in the form of targeted ads. As this information has been collected without consent most of the time, it can influence the person’s views, and negatively affect the reliability and integrity of companies.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Americans are more concerned about their data privacy, about how their data is collected, than losing their income which shows the importance of this issue (TrustArc, 2016, January 27).  Even with the promise of keeping their data safe, further evidence shows that data privacy is still a prevalent issue throughout the years, with more than 50% of the population worldwide showing concerns for their personal information (Petrosyan, 2022, July 7) (see <b>Picture 3</b>). These could be mainly due to data breaches that have become more prevalent in this world full of technological advancements.</p>
            <p>One of the most serious issues with data security are data breaches. In 2021, a global study found that in nearly half (44%) of the breaches analysed, the most common types of personal data exposed were names, emails, passwords, and healthcare data (IBM, 2021). Cyberattacks, such as hacking, can result in unauthorised access, theft, or exposure of sensitive data which can have severe consequences such as, but not limited to, identity theft, financial fraud, and potential harm to the user’s privacy and security. These data breaches also demonstrate the vulnerability of organisations and their ability in protecting sensitive data, which erodes trust in the company’s ability to safeguard information. And with data protection laws varying by country, even these may not be enough to safeguard an individual’s rights. </p>
